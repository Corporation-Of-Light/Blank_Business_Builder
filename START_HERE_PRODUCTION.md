## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use environment variables** - Never hardcode secrets
2. **Monitor first 24 hours** - Watch metrics closely after deploy
3. **Test backups regularly** - Restore to staging monthly
4. **Review logs daily** - Catch issues early
5. **Scale early** - Add capacity before peak demand
6. **Document changes** - Keep runbooks updated
7. **Practice incidents** - Test alerting and response
8. **Update dependencies** - Weekly security patches
