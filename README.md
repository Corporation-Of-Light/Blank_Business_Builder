2. **Deploy Agents** (Instant): Level 6 AI agents activate and start working
3. **Monitor** (Optional): Check your dashboard to see revenue growth
4. **Get Paid** (Automatic): Agents generate revenue, you collect checks

Target: **$20,000+ per quarter** in passive income.

## Quick Start

> Requires Python 3.9 or later.

```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from blank_business_builder import OnboardingAssistant
from blank_business_builder.autonomous_business import launch_autonomous_business
import asyncio

# Traditional onboarding
assistant = OnboardingAssistant()
outcome = assistant.run()
print(outcome["plan"][0])

# Launch autonomous business
async def main():
    metrics = await launch_autonomous_business(
        business_concept="AI Chatbot Integration Service",
        founder_name="Your Name",
        duration_hours=24.0
    )
    print(f"Revenue generated: ${metrics['metrics']['revenue']['total']}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## How the Quantum Forecast Works

The `QuantumOptimizer` converts projected quarterly profits into probability amplitudes (squared amplitudes sum to one). Concepts with stronger profit signals receive higher measurement probabilities. The optimizer:

1. Projects three-month profit, modelling ramp-up months before full revenue.
2. Filters out ideas that fail the $4,500/month floor when alternatives exist.
3. Flags whether the $20,000 quarterly target is met so you can iterate if the bar is not hit.

This is intentionally lightweightâ€”no external quantum SDK is requiredâ€”yet the amplitude model keeps the selection logic explainable.

## Jiminy Cricket Oversight

The assistant instantiates a mini Jiminy Cricket guardian each run. It:

- Verifies that a LICENSE file exists (if absent, you are reminded to add one).
- Emits reminders about regulatory compliance and manual verification steps.
- Wraps the intake session inside a conscience context so you receive completion cues.

Add your own checks by passing a custom `JiminyCricket` instance into `OnboardingAssistant`.

## Extending Business Ideas

Additional business templates can be appended to `src/blank_business_builder/business_data.py`. For each idea specify:

- `startup_cost`
- `expected_monthly_revenue`
- `expected_monthly_expenses`
- `time_commitment_hours_per_week`
- `ramp_up_months`

The optimizer instantly reevaluates the new portfolio during the next run.

## Roadmap

- Optional HTTP integration to validate government portal uptime with retries.
- Export onboarding plans to Markdown or Notion for follow-up tracking.
- Integrate additional compliance checkpoints per state.

Operate ethically, confirm each regulatory step manually, and use the IRS portal above for official EIN issuance.
