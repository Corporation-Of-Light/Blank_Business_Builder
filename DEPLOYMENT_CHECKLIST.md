## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **DNS Propagation:** TTL set to 30 min for quick updates. After deployment, can increase to 24 hours for stability.

2. **GitHub Pages:** Automatically caches and serves from CDN. Super fast and reliable.

3. **SSL Certificate:** GitHub auto-issues and auto-renews. No setup needed.

4. **Custom Domain:** All GitHub Pages features (redirects, 404 pages, etc.) work with custom domains.

5. **Updates:** Any git push to /docs folder automatically deploys to bbb.aios.is.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Q: Site shows "404 - There isn't a GitHub Pages site here"**
- A: Check CNAME file in repo (should be "bbb.aios.is")
- Wait 10 minutes for GitHub to recognize domain
- Verify Pages setting in repo → Settings → Pages

**Q: DNS not updating**
- A: TTL = 30 min, wait that long
- Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Try different device/network to verify propagation

**Q: SSL certificate error**
- A: Wait 10-15 minutes after DNS propagates
- GitHub takes time to issue certificate
- Keep trying - it will work

**Q: Domain resolves to wrong page**
- A: Check DNS records at Namecheap
- Verify you edited Advanced DNS, not regular settings
- Check CNAME or A records have correct values
